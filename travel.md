## Planning your trip

* [Fill out this Google Form to inform us of your plans to attend by June 20](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XQJeJLqJXu6Fa5ZNSg0f4QL1aLSLsYpZJ6ul2ck7-8E/edit) Because getting to Shoals can be logitically complicated, informing us of your travel plans can be helpful if any delays arise.
* Please buy travel insurance if relevant, as we cannot use NSF funds to reimburse you for travel if you do not for some reason make it to the workshop.

### Getting reimbursed

Northeastern University is managing the RCN and **does not process per diem reimbursements.** Please save all your travel receipts (food, taxi, etc.) for reimbursement. 

We will cover reimbursement paperwork during the workshop. Up to 50% of reimbursement forms are sent back because they are incomplete, so please take care to follow instructions.

All reimbursements will be due 1 week after the workshop.

#### Preparing your reimbursement
You will submit three files in one email for your reimbursement. *Please be sure to use the standardized file name* 

1. **W9_LastName_FirstName.pdf** (Make sure to sign the W9 and check that the address is where the check will be sent) 
2. **Voucher_LastName_FirstName.xls**. Excel form voucher reimbursement (do not convert this to pdf, submit it as an excel file. You can type your signature or insert a photo for a signature)
3. **Receipts_LastName_FirstName.pdf** a combined pdf with all receipts. Each charge has to have its own receipt and food receipts must be itemized. There is no reimbursements for alcohol or sales tax, so please remove the tax and alcohol from the amount you are requesting. Please highlight the sales tax and other non-reimburseable expenses on your receipts and subtract them from the totals in the Excel form. 

#### Submitting your reimbursement
Send the three files in a single email to Thais Bittar with the *exact subject line "RCN Workshop 2022"*, which will automatically route your email for rapid processing.

Anticipate reimbursement by a check in the mail roughly 4-6 weeks after we verify that the correct paperwork has been submitted.

### Forms due Aug 1

* All participants need to fill out SML's [visitor forms and waivers](https://learnforlife.unh.edu/portal/applications/applicationProfile.do?method=loadApplicationIndex&applicationProfileId=152537322). If you are traveling with children or caregivers, a form needs to be filled out for each person in your group. _Please fill the waivers out by August 1_

### Life on the island

The facility is a field station and the important things to know are that the facilities are not designed for accessibility, there is not a great deal of privacy, and the conditions can occasionally be uncomfortable; especially in poor weather.  August is generally an amazing time for Appledore weather, but there are always exceptions.  They have a strict no-pet policy to protect the wildlife and ecosystem of the island.  They are very conscientious about allergies and dietary restrictions.  Generally, if a person can eat in a restaurant, they can be accommodated in our dining facility.

There is no air conditioning. There will be wi-fi access, and there IS cell reception.

You many want to bring a bathing suit or snorkeling gear to cool off.

Bring sheets (fitted sheet, top sheet, and pillow case). Some guests find it easier to bring a sleeping bag! The mattresses are long twins. Shoals will provide blankets and pillows!
